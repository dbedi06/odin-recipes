  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Pipérade, or piperrada as it is known in Spain, is a flavorful stew made from peppers,
    tomatoes, and onions slow-cooked in olive oil. Classically, it always included beaten
    eggs that were cooked in the vegetable mixture. Often a thick slice of Jambon de Bayonne,
    a slightly sweet, air-cured ham similar to prosciutto, was fried and served over the top.
    Nowadays, it has become a more foundational element; often appearing in many different guises and cusines.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4-6 medium tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 large red bell peppers, cored</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
    <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>a pinch of dried thyme</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp piment d'Espelette (or 1 fresh mild chili, de-seeded and chopped plus 1/2 tsp mil chili powder)</li>
    <li>2 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Peel the tomatoes: score a cross in the base of each and plunge them into a pan of boiling water.
      Let them simmer for 30 seconds, drain and rinse with cold water. The skin should now peel easily.
    </li>
    <li>De-seed the tomatoes and chop them roughly. Set aside. Slice the peppers thinly lengthwise into strips.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet heat 1 tbsp. olive oil over medium heat and add the smashed garlic.
      Fry it for a couple of minutes until scorched on both sides. Remove from the pan.
    </li>
    <li>Turn up the heat and add the pepper slices. Cook them on high heat, stirring, for 2 minutes.
      Remove the peppers onto a plate.
    </li>
    <li>Turn the heat down and add the other tbsp. of oil. Add the onion to the skillet, season with a
      large pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 minutes until softened but not coloured. (If you’re using
      fresh chilli, cook it with the onion.)
    </li>
    <li>Add the chopped tomatoes, scorched garlic, thyme and piment d’Espelette (or chilli powder).
      Stir, cover and cook for 30 minutes over low heat. When the sauce is thick and the tomatoes have all
      broken down, add the vinegar and sugar; taste and adjust.
    </li>
    <li>Return the peppers to the pan, stir and cover.
      Cook for 15 minutes until the peppers have wilted but retain shape and some bite.
    </li>
    <li>Serve warm rather than hot; on fresh or toasted bread or as a side dish.</li>
  </ol>
